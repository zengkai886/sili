"""Tests for the progressive-disclosure references/ sidecar install path.

The real claude bundle now ships in the package (graphify/skills/claude/), so
claude and its reuse twins (antigravity, kimi) install progressively: a lean
SKILL.md plus a references/ sidecar. Every other host whose bundle has not
shipped yet still installs today's byte-identical monolith.

The plumbing tests below stage a hand-made fake bundle in claude's slot so the
dir-copy, version-stamp, reinstall, and uninstall flow can be exercised with
fixed, asserted content. The fixture backs up the real committed bundle and
restores it on teardown, so the working tree is never disturbed.
