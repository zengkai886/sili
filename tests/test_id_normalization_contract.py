"""Drift guard for the node-ID normalization contract.

Three independent producers must agree on node IDs or the graph splits one entity
into disconnected ghost nodes: the AST extractor (``extract._make_id``), the
semantic subagents (the skill prompt's node-ID spec), and the graph builder
(``build._normalize_id``, which reconciles edge endpoints). The recipe used to be
copy-pasted into ``_make_id`` and ``_normalize_id`` and kept in sync only by
mirrored docstrings — exactly how the recurring ID-drift bug class crept in
(#811 Unicode collapse, #550 same-filename collisions, #1033 AST-vs-LLM file-node
mismatch, #1104).

Both callers now delegate to :mod:`graphify.ids`, so they share one
implementation and cannot diverge. These tests lock that contract: if a future
change re-forks the normalization (a new local helper, an inlined regex, a
dropped ``casefold``), they fail.
