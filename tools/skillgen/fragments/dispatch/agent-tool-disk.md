**Step B2 - Dispatch ALL subagents in a single message**

Call the Agent tool multiple times IN THE SAME RESPONSE - one call per chunk. This is the only way they run in parallel. If you make one Agent call, wait, then make another, you are doing it sequentially and defeating the purpose.

**IMPORTANT - subagent type:** Always use `subagent_type="general-purpose"`. Do NOT use `Explore` - it is read-only and cannot write chunk files to disk, which silently drops extraction results. General-purpose has Write and Bash access which the subagent needs.

Concrete example for 3 chunks:
```
[Agent tool call 1: files 1-15, subagent_type="general-purpose"]
[Agent tool call 2: files 16-30, subagent_type="general-purpose"]
[Agent tool call 3: files 31-45, subagent_type="general-purpose"]
```
All three in one message. Not three separate messages.

Each subagent receives this exact prompt (substitute FILE_LIST, CHUNK_NUM, TOTAL_CHUNKS, DEEP_MODE, and CHUNK_PATH).

CHUNK_PATH must be an **absolute** path — derive it before dispatching:
```bash
PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)  # cwd — where Part C globs graphify-out/ (NOT .graphify_root/scan dir, #1392)
# Then for chunk N: CHUNK_PATH="${PROJECT_ROOT}/graphify-out/.graphify_chunk_0N.json"
```

Subagent prompt template:

See `references/extraction-spec.md` for the exact subagent prompt (JSON schema, node-ID rules, confidence rubric, frontmatter, hyperedge, and vision rules). Load it only here, only when at least one chunk holds a doc, paper, or image; a pure-code corpus has skipped Part B and never reads it. Pass each subagent that prompt verbatim with FILE_LIST, CHUNK_NUM, TOTAL_CHUNKS, DEEP_MODE, and CHUNK_PATH substituted, and have it write the result to CHUNK_PATH.
